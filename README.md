 Introduction
==============

This repository archives StrBEAM implementation. StrBEAM stands for 'Structured
Bayesian Epistasis Association Mapping'. This program is documented in
'Population-Structured Bayesian Epistasis Association Mapping' paper and I
presented it in [13-th Seminar on Probability and Stochastic Process of Iranian
Statistical Society](http://spsp13.hsu.ac.ir/).


You can build presentation slides in PDF format, by running __build.bat__ script
in __Slides__ directory.



 Abstract
==========

Association mapping is an important field of research in bioinformatics and
human genomics studies. Various statistical methods have been used to find out
genetic regions are associated with traits or phenotypes. One of the methods
used in the association mapping is clustering. In this paper, we introduce a
clustering method with special application in association mapping. In this
method, the inference of disease associated factors of each sub-population is
simultaneously performed by clustering assignment of individuals, based on
similarity of genetic samples. A framework is proposed to approximate the
posterior of the model based on, either Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), or
Variational Bayes (VB) methods, and Bayesian Epistasis Association Mapping
(BEAM) model for disease association discovery.
